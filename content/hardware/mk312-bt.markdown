## MK312-BT

The MK312-BT is an open source, DIY electrosimulation box meant for
sexual play. It has many of the same features as
the [Erostek ET-312](http://buttplug.io/hardware/erostek-et-312),
while also including bluetooth support, the ability to switch CPUs and
other chips, and availability of full source code and schematics.
