#### libtrancevibe

libtrancevibe allows developers to connect to Trance Vibrators and
compatible devices, and set the speed of the vibration motor.

_NOTE:_ Due to changes in Windows >= 8.1, the Trance Vibrator may no
longer be recognized by Windows upon connection. We are currently
working to resolve this issue.

### Where You Can Buy Them

The original Rez Trance Vibrator is no longer produced. It can
sometimes be found on eBay or other video game auction sites.

The [Drmn Trance Vibe](http://tim.cexx.org/projects/vibe/), a DIY
version of the Rez Trance Vibrator, is no longer produced. However,
schematics and firmware for the hardware are available
at [the project website](http://tim.cexx.org/projects/vibe/).

The
[Harnett USBMC-01](http://www.harnett-tech.com/search.php?act=search&SKU=USBMC-01) is
a replica of the original TranceVibrator control hardware, minus the
motor. Users can use small bullet/egg vibrators with the controller,
as long as they do not pull more power than a single USB bus can
provide.
