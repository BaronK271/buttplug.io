# Fleshlight Launch

Released in March 2017, the Fleshlight Launch is a thrusting sex toy,
co-developed by [Kiiroo](/hardware/kiiroo) and Fleshlight. The toy
holds a standard sized fleshlight case, and moves the fleshlight up
and down. The communications protocol allows software to set the
absolute position and movement speed for the device.
