When writing software for hobby projects, there's a tendency to go
"Oh, I want to learn [thing]" and add that to the stack of things
required to build the project. So far, buttplug has been no exception.

<!--more-->

Using [Rust](http://www.rustlang.org) to build the desktop version was
a great start for that. While Rust is a fantastic language that's
really coming into its own, and provides great facilities for safe
programming (something that doesn't happen in sex toys much if ever),
the library ecosystem leaves a bit to be desired. There's not much in
the way of GUI or hardware access libraries, and things like Bluetooth
4 libraries are basically non-existant (I
realize [blurz](https://github.com/szeged/blurz) exists, but it's
linux/dbus only). Instead of just writing libraries to support the toy
hardware, I decided to try and fill things in, writing
a
[simple systray application library](http://github.com/qdot/systray-rs),
which I'll then just use for status and opening a browser based GUI.

Hardware is still a problem, though. Serial and USB Sex Toys shouldn't
be too difficult to deal with, as there's
already [serial](https://github.com/dcuddeback/serial-rs)
and [libusb](https://github.com/dcuddeback/libusb-rs) bindings for
rust. Unfortunately, most sex toys these days are Bluetooth 4/BLE, so
serial and USB only get me support for legacy toys. I haven't been
able to find libraries in ANY language that handle full Windows
10/macOS/Linux
BLE. [node.js's noble](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/noble) comes
close, but still doesn't work with Win10 UWP bluetooth APIs (though
that support will
be
[coming in with the noble-uwp repo](https://github.com/jasongin/noble-uwp) the
Creator's update next month). There's more info on desktop
bluetooth
[in this article I wrote on the subject last year](https://kyle.machul.is/2016/11/07/talking-bluetooth-le-on-desktop-in-2016/).

Speaking of noble and node.js, at some point I decided one of the
[things] I need to learn was node. I've been developing hardware
access libraries in 3 languages:

- Python: For proof of concept work, as this is the language I work
  fastest in
- Rust: For buttplug application work
- Javascript: To both learn node and WebBluetooth, meaning that for
  browsers supports WebBluetooth, no software has to be downloaded.

Then there's the toys themselves. I've been picking up a bunch of new
toys lately, including
the [Vorze Interactive](http://vorzeinteractive.com)
and [Fleshlight Launch](http://fleshlight.com/launch). Getting new
toys means:

- Reverse engineering the toy
- Writing documentation
- Taking pictures
- Adding a buttplug.io page
- Writing libraries
- THEN trying to figure out integration with the buttplug application
  framework

Needless to say, I haven't made it very far into development of the
actual Buttplug application yet.

To remedy this, I'm trying to give myself a good first goal for
release. Coming up with these goals has been driven off conversations
with [my patreon funders](http://patreon.com/qdot) and members of
communities like
the [RealTouchScripts Forum](http://realtouchscripts.com), as well as
assessing how I want to use what I've learned so far. The problem
being that buttplug in itself is more of a development platform and
less of an end-user application. That means adding yet another project
to the pile, that will exercise the applications and the libraries in
a way that's interesting to both me and users.

With that in mind, I've created a repository for something I'm
calling [SyncyDink](http://github.com/metafetish/syncydync). There's a
trend these days of make web-based video players for toys, since it's
fairly easy to throw together a GUI and play videos in HTML, and get
the timing information out of them via javascript and
requestAnimationFrame updates. However, every player uses a different
format for their specific toy. Making a single player that can take
the formats and send them to the Buttplug application (or just
straight thru to WebBluetooth for platforms and toys that support it)
seems like a good goal for QA'ing things. There's already a TON of
haptics-encoded content out there, as well as people familiar with
using it.

... But also it means I get to play with WebVR for 180 SBS videos. 

See? I keep shaving, and the yaks keep coming out of the factory.

Expect Buttplug and SyncyDink to be released sometime near the heat
death of the universe.
