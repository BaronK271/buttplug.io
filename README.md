This repo contains the https://buttplug.io website build files. It
uses [Hexo](https://hexo.io) for static site management.

## Building

The package file contains scripts for building the website. Using
yarn, you can just do a 

    yarn build

To build the website. To host a local version for testing, use 

    yarn start

## Translations

Translations are managed through [crowdin](https://crowdin.com). The
website content is managed through a set of yaml files which are
modular and can be translated as necessary.

If you are interested in translating the website to a new language, or
helping with translation and proofreading on a language we already
support, please file an issue with a "translation" label.
